## KlackEnder Probe

KlackEnder Probe - **Simple, fast and cheap!**
  
Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable         Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3. The cost of the probe is <5â‚¬, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with **Marlin and Klipper**. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both    firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default formware settings or with G29.

### Quick Overwiew:
- Compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Firmware is provided.
- Automatic docking and undocking of the probe.
- Cuatom menu to control the probe.
- Cheap way to get fast and accurate probing.
- Easy to install, no soldering.
- Works with all print surfaces

    Its working very well for me. If you have any questions ask me here or feel free to contact me on Discord: kevinakasam#2097

### BOM - Parts you need:
- 1x OMRON D2F or similar switch
- 4x Magnet 3x6mm 
- 2x M3x8mm screw (SHCS or BHCS doesn't matter)
- 3x M5x8mm screw (SHCS or BHCS doesn't matter)
- 3x M5 t-nut
- small cable tie and some cable (you may also need a connector to connect the probe to the mainboard e.g JST XH)


## Assembly Guide
I made a short video about the assembly and installation of the probe.

Wiring and firmware changes are described at the bottom of the page.

## Wiring Guide
Since there is no polarity on Swichtes, it doesn't matter which wire goes where. Just connect the switch to the two marked pins.
In the next chapter about firmware changes you will see where to add the pin.

#### Ender 3 V2 / Silent Board V4.2.7 (or all Creality3D V4.x.x)
- Connect the probe to the two marked pins (G and Out). This pins would be also used to connect a BL-Touch.

## Firmware Guide
The KlackEnder probe works with Marlin and Klipper. This guide only shows you what changes you need to make to the firmware, not how to modify/upload the firmware itself. There are several guides online for different boards and printers.
**You do not have to use the ```Probe In``` or ```Probe Out``` macros.** They're just a nice to have. The printer will do this automatically when you send a ```G29```.

### Klipper


The installation for Klipper is pretty easy. Simply upload the ```KlackEnder.cfg```and add ```[include KlackEnder.cfg]```to your printer.cfg
You could also copy all the code into your printer.cfg so you only have one file, but I like to organize and sort my configurations.
The ```[gcode_macro G29]``` does the same like the ```[gcode_macro AUTO_BED_MESH]```. I just added this so you can use the G29 commend as usual.

### Marlin
The installation for Marlin requires some more changes, but I will guide you through this :)  There is also a zipped Marlin file. This is exactly the same configuration I used for testing. It contains the Probe related thins only!! Do not flash this to your printer!!

#### 1. Configuration.h

Search for ```// @section homing``` and change
