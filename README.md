Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3. The cost of the probe is <5â‚¬, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with **Marlin and Klipper**. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default formware settings or with G29.
