## KlackEnder Probe

KlackEnder Probe - **Simple, fast and cheap!**
  
Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable         Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3. The cost of the probe is <5â‚¬, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with **Marlin and Klipper**. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both    firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default formware settings or with G29. **Important note: You have to set the offset to the z limit switch, not to the probe! The printer calculates the first layer from the z endstops position and the probed mesh!**

### Quick Overwiew:
- Compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Firmware is provided.
- Automatic docking and undocking of the probe.
- Cuatom menu to control the probe.
- Cheap way to get fast and accurate probing.
- Easy to install, no soldering.
- Works with all print surfaces
- **Use it as Z Endstop with the Rev2**
